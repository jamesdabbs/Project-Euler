This project is my excuse to learn Haskell by working through the `Project Euler
problems <https://projecteuler.net/problems/>`_.  This is my first experience
writing Haskell, so don't expect any revelatory code.  Comments are always
welcome.

TODO:
=====
Solve more problems

Improve run times on problems that take >1 minute to solve
* 14 - the lookup table never actually gets used
* 21
* 23
* 47
* 120
* 188
* 206

Learn file input and redo
* 22
* 42

Others
* 33 - there should be a more recursive / less repetitive way to do this
* 46 - requires specifying a range to check. It'd be nice to have a(n infinite?)
       list of all numbers that can't be written as p + 2k^2 (p prime)
* 63 - provide a convincing reason why the bound works
